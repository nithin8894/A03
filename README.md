a) branch:A branch is a copy of a codeline, managed in a version control system (VCS). Branching helps software development teams work in parallel. It separates out “in-progress work” from tested and stable code. The codebase in a VCS is often referred to as the trunk, baseline, master, or mainline.
b) clone:Website cloning refers to the copying or modification of an existing website design or script to create a new website. Website cloning allows designers to create websites without the need to write scripts from scratch.
c) commit: a commit adds the latest changes to [part of] the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository. Unlike commits in data management, commits in version control systems are kept in the repository indefinitely.
