a) branch:A branch is a copy of a codeline, managed in a version control system (VCS). Branching helps software development teams work in parallel. It separates out “in-progress work” from tested and stable code. The codebase in a VCS is often referred to as the trunk, baseline, master, or mainline.
b) clone:Website cloning refers to the copying or modification of an existing website design or script to create a new website. Website cloning allows designers to create websites without the need to write scripts from scratch.
c) commit: a commit adds the latest changes to [part of] the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository. Unlike commits in data management, commits in version control systems are kept in the repository indefinitely.
d) fetch:Fetch is the retrieval of data by a software program, script, or hardware device. After being retrieved, the data is moved to an alternate location or displayed on a screen.
e) GIT: Git is a free open-source Version Control System originally created by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernal development. Linus is a very smart guy; when he sets out to solve a problem, he doesn't mess around. One of Git's big differentiators is that unlike SVN and CVS it is a distributed version control system.
f) Github: GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
g)merge:  merging (also called integration) is a fundamental operation that reconciles multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of files. Most often, it is necessary when a file is modified on two independent branches and subsequently merged.
h) merge conflict: A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.
 i) push:  is the delivery of information on the Web that is initiated by the information server rather than by the information user or client , as it usually is.
 j) pull: coding or client pull is a style of network communication where the initial request for data originates from the client, and then is responded to by the server. ... Pull is used extensively on the Internet for HTTP page requests from websites.
 K) resporitary: In software development, a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files. While a repository can be configured on a local machine for a single user, it is often stored on a server, which can be accessed by multiple users.
